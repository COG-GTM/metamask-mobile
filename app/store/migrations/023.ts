/**
 * Migrate address book state to be keyed by chain ID rather than network ID.
 *
 * When choosing which chain ID to migrate each address book entry to, we
 * consider only networks that the user has configured locally. Any entries
 * for chains not configured locally are discarded.
 *
 * If there are multiple chain ID candidates for a given network ID (even
 * after filtering to include just locally configured networks), address
 * entries are duplicated on all potentially matching chains. These cases are
 * also stored in the `user.ambiguousAddressEntries` state so that we can
 * warn the user in the UI about these addresses.
 *
 * Note: the type is wrong here because it conflicts with `redux-persist`
 * types, due to a bug in that package.
 * See: https://github.com/rt2zz/redux-persist/issues/1065
 * TODO: Use `unknown` as the state type, and silence or work around the
 * redux-persist bug somehow.
