/**
 * Migrate NetworkController state, splitting old `network` property into
 * `networkId` and `networkStatus`. This is required to update to v8 of the
 * NetworkController package.
 *
 * @see {@link https://github.com/MetaMask/core/blob/main/packages/network-controller/CHANGELOG.md#800}
 *
 * Note: the type is wrong here because it conflicts with `redux-persist`
 * types, due to a bug in that package.
 * See: https://github.com/rt2zz/redux-persist/issues/1065
 * TODO: Use `unknown` as the state type, and silence or work around the
 * redux-persist bug somehow.
